        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3><a href="https://terraform.balaji.website">ROBOSHOP</a> - An E-commerce Platform</h3>
        <p>Deployed and managed a scalable, <strong>3-Tier</strong> microservices architecture from an open-source
            e-commerce application
            built
            using Node.js, Java, Python and MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, MySQL as databases. Focused
            on robust infrastructure and CI/CD automation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> Used Terraform to provision VPC, subnets (public/private/DB),
                dual ALBs (public & internal), launch templates with spot instances, NAT instance, ACM-based HTTPS, and
                centralized S3 logging — all automated end-to-end with a
                single apply.</li>
            <li><strong>CI/CD Automation:</strong> Built a Jenkins-as-Code pipeline with GitHub webhooks,
                change-in-code detection logic, automated Docker image builds and tagging, and safe live redeployment
                workflows with
                user approval.</li>
            <li><strong>Containerized Deployment:</strong> Dockerized all microservices and managed deployment with
                Docker Compose; container images hosted on <a
                    href="https://hub.docker.com/r/kbalaji2212/roboshop/tags">Docker Hub</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring Stack:</strong> Integrated Prometheus (scraping), Grafana (dashboards), cAdvisor, and
                Node Exporter to monitor hosts and containers.</li>
            <li><strong>Network & Security:</strong> Enforced subnet-level isolation with zero internet exposure for app
                and database tiers; enabled HTTPS via ACM and routed traffic using host-based rules through internal
                ALB.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://balaji.website/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a> - A Serverless AWS Web Application</h3>

        <p>Designed and deployed a fully serverless web application on AWS to host a personal resume site with an
            integrated visitor counter, showcasing hands-on expertise in cloud architecture, automation, and
            deployment.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Developed a responsive static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                hosted on Amazon S3, and delivered securely and globally via CloudFront CDN with HTTPS enabled
                through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).</li>

            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Implemented a serverless backend using Python-based AWS Lambda function
                and DynamoDB as database to
                track and store visitor counts. Utilized Lambda Function URLs for a simplified, API Gateway-free
                integration with frontend JavaScript.</li>

            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Integrated CI/CD using Jenkins to automatically deploy changes to
                backend infrastructure and code, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery pipelines.</li>

            <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> Employed Terraform to provision and manage all AWS
                resources, ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and version-controlled infrastructure.</li>

            <li><strong>Monitoring & Logging:</strong> Enabled CloudWatch Logs for backend observability and
                operational insight.</li>

            <li><strong>Domain & DNS:</strong> Configured a custom domain with Route 53, improving accessibility and
                establishing a professional web presence.</li>
